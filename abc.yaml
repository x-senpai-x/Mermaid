✅ This will render the full Mermaid diagram on GitHub.com  
🚫 It **won’t render** in tools like VS Code unless you install a Mermaid plugin.

### ⚙️ For local preview:

If you want to preview Mermaid diagrams **locally**, here are your options:

- **VS Code + Markdown Preview Mermaid Support extension**  
  [Install here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vstirbu.vscode-mermaid-preview)

- **Use a Markdown previewer that supports Mermaid**, like:
  - [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
  - [Marktext](https://marktext.app/)
  - [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/)

Want me to polish that section and write a GitHub-ready `README.md` block for you?
